 * The Galaxy S9's cameras (starlte, Exynos 9810): the front camera, a Samsung S5K3H1 (Android's camera 1,
 * "fimc-is_sensor_3h1"), from its supplies to one raw frame in memory, without the ISP's libraries. Only with boot-arg
 * cam_s9=N on this phone; nothing is written at cam_s9=0 (the default). Every address and number below belongs to this
 * phone, from its device tree and the S9 kernel's camera driver (fimc-is2), read as data.
 *
 * STAGE 1, THE SENSOR (cam_s9=1, 2)
 *   the sensor     0x35 (7 bits; 0x6A as Samsung's node name writes it) on hsi2c@108F0000, the second I2C of USI08
 *                  of PERIC1 ("USI08_I2C"), 400 kHz; its pins gpp5-2 (SCL) and gpp5-3 (SDA), function 3 ("on_i2c"),

 *                  The star boards define USE_BUCK2_REGULATOR_CONTROL (fimc-is-vendor-config_star.h), and the 3H1's
 *                  module file then switches BUCK2 on first and off last: the 1.3 V the low-voltage LDOs (VDDD's
 *                  LDO5 among them) are made from. Without it VDDD is "on" with nothing behind it, and the sensor does
 *                  not answer (the first phone run, 2 November: 0x35 NACKed, INT_STAT's no-device bit, 0x400)
 *   power-up       (the module file's, fimc-is-device-module-3h1.c, star's): CIS_CLK1 on at 26 MHz; reset low; BUCK2

 *                  times are 100 us for a buck, 180 us for an LDO). If the model ID is not read: 20 ms more and again,
 *                  then the bus's and the pins' registers logged and the bus scanned (below)
 *   power-down     MCLK's pin to an output, low; reset low; the bus pins back to inputs; VDDAF, VDDD, VDDA, VDDIO off,
 *                  BUCK2 off (the module file's order); CIS_CLK1's gate, Q-channel, mux and divider as found. BUCK2's
 *                  voltage register stays at 1.3 V, the value Linux's regulator core gives it at boot (min = max)
 *   the scan       only when the sensor does not answer at 0x35: a one-byte READ at every 7-bit address 0x08-0x77
 *                  (nothing is written to anyone), the addresses that acknowledge listed; then, of those, only the
 *                  other addresses a 3H1 can be strapped to (0x10, 0x1A, 0x20, 0x2D, 0x36, 0x5A: never 0x50-0x57, an
 *                  EEPROM's) are asked for the model ID (a 16-bit register address written, two bytes read), and
 *                  one that gives an ID other than 0 and 0xffff is used for the run. cam_s9_addr=A forces one
 *
 * STAGE 2, CSIS1 AND ITS DMA (cam_s9=3, 4)
 *   the domain     ISPPRE (pd-isppre@14064048): the PMU's ISPPRE_CONFIGURATION 0x14064048 [3:0] = 0xF, its STATUS
 *                  0x1406404C [3:0] waited for 0xF (pmucal isppre_on); off: [3:0] = 0, STATUS 0. Its parent in the

 *                  address is the DMA's. Found on, there is no frame: this driver gives it no table. Unprobed (the
 *                  default), it is taken as off and never touched
 *   the buffer     4 MB below 4 GB (the WDMA's addresses are 32 bits). XNU has no memory there on the S9 (its RAM is
 *                  the bank from 0x880000000: kmem's "below 4 GB" never succeeds), so it is physical memory XNU does
 *                  not manage, in the device tree's gap: the camera's 32 MB from 0xD8000000 in sys/hakios.exynos9810_mem.h
 *                  (the raw frames, then camshot's picture), above the display's buffers and the moved payload,
 *                  below UFS's own-mode memory; never 0xF0000000 and above (the modem's, ABOX's).
 *                  Mapped once through IOKit, write-combined (hakios_physmap_wc()), never with ml_io_map()
 *                  (io_submap is 8 MB); filled with 0xA5 first, so that what the DMA wrote shows
 *
 * STAGE 3, A FRAME (cam_s9=5)
 *   the mode       1632 x 1224 RAW10 at 30 frames a second, two lanes at 719 Mb/s, VC0 (module-3h1's mode 5, with the
 *                  embedded data on CH2 as its CSI_MODE_VC_DT config gives it): setfile A's (the device tree's
 *                  "default") table sensor_3h1_setfile_A_1632x1224_30fps, 86 16-bit writes taken as given, after 3 ms
 *                  (sensor_cis_set_registers); then 0x3092 = 0 (no companion chip: sensor_3h1_cis_mode_change). The

 *                  403.6 MHz: 26.3 us a line, 33.3 ms a frame. The exposure: coarse integration 0x0202 (cam_s9_exp,
 *                  1000 lines unless said; at most the frame's less 4) and analog gain 0x0204 (cam_s9_gain, 0x40:

 *   the settle     36 (fimc-is-hw-settle-10nm-lpp.h at 720 Mb/s, the table fimc-is-v6_0_0's chain takes)
 *   stream on      0x0104 = 0 (group hold off), 8 ms, 0x6028 = 0x4000, 0x0100 = 1, 0x0216 = 0 (no WDR)

 *   stream off     0x0104 = 0, 0x6028 = 0x4000, 0x0100 = 0; the frame count back to 0xff. The link: lanes off,
 *                  CSI_EN 0, QCHANNEL_EN 1 (csi_hw_disable), the reset; the WDMA's output off
 *
 * THE STEPS. cam_s9=N makes the first N and stops; each is said before it is taken:
 *   1  reads   the pins, CMU_TOP's CIS_CLK1, the two buses as found, the S2MPB02's ID and the four LDOs' registers
 *   2  writes  the sensor powered up, its model ID, revision, frame count and mode read; powered down again (at 5:
 *              kept up for step 5)
 *   3  writes  the ISPPRE domain on (and its DTZPC restore), its clocks; reads CSIS1's version, its WDMA, the DMA
 *              common (the SysMMU's state with cam_s9_mmu_probe=1)
 *   4  writes  the D-PHY's isolation off and its reset released, CSIS1 reset and set up for 1632 x 1224 RAW10, the
 *              buffer given to VC0's WDMA (a stale DMA abort request in its DMA_CMN_CTRL cleared first), the test
 *              pattern generator on: first as Android has it, CSIS1's link left off (csi_stream_on with pattern_en),
 *              500 ms; if no frame has started on CSIS1's WDMA by then, the pattern off and on again with the link
 *              enabled as csi_hw_enable does (no clock lane: no sensor), 1.5 s; then the WDMA and the pattern off. The
 *              other three CSISs' DMA interrupts are unmasked for the while (put back after), so the log says which
 *              WDMA the pattern reached if not CSIS1's. The buffer's checksum, its first bytes, how much of it changed
 *   5  writes  the sensor's mode table, the D-PHY's settle for 719 Mb/s, the link on, the ring (four 4 MB slots)
 *              given to VC0's WDMA's eight frame pointers, streaming; the auto-exposure: the green of the frame's middle
 *              metered on every third frame and the exposure stepped towards 18 % grey (coarse integration time, then
 *              analog gain, then digital gain, within the mode's 1266-line frame) until it is there or
 *              cam_s9_ae_frames frames have passed (15 unless said); that frame is the one taken: the WDMA off, streaming off; the
 *              counters, the link's errors, the checksum and the mean of a 64 x 64 patch in the middle (a black frame
 *              reads about 64 in 10 bits)
 *   6  camshot: steps 1 to 5 as above at the start, then the thread stays for the USB console's "camshot [N] [tp]"
 *              (hakios.dwc3.c, usb_gadget=5): each one makes steps 2 to 5 again (with "tp", 3 and 4: the test pattern),
 *              everything off again, then the frame demosaiced on the processor (bilinear, the whole 1632 x 1224 at
 *              N = 1, every Nth pixel at N; the black level off, a grey-world balance kept to sane gains, a saturation,
 *              a gamma of about 1/2.2) and handed to the USB link, which sends it as it sends a shot of the panel. A
 *              capture that fails says "usb: camshot failed: ..." with CSIS1's and the WDMA's status.
 *              tools/usb-shot.py --cam
 *   7  the stream: after step 1's look (nothing is powered), the sensor streams into the ring while something wants
 *              the frames, with the auto-exposure running all along; /dev/hakios-camera gives the newest frame to user
 *              space (the POCO's protocol, bsd/sys/hakios.camera.h: libhakios.media's capture device and camera_test
 *              read it). The first read after an open brings the camera up; it goes down again (the sensor, its
 *              supplies, the link, the domain) at the last close, or after STREAM_IDLE_MS without a read. camshot
 *              wakes it too, and takes its frame once the auto-exposure has had cam_s9_ae_frames frames. The log says
 *              the frame rate every ten seconds of a stream
 * Whatever a run switched on is switched off again in the reverse order, also when a step fails, and at the run's end
 * (loader_return(), a panic's way out too): the WDMA and the pattern first, then the sensor, the link, the PHY, the
 * domain (if this run switched it on). A WDMA not seen to stop: no more DMA into the buffer for the run.

 *                      4 one frame of the test pattern into memory, 5 one frame of the sensor's, 6 that and then the
 *                      USB console's camshot, 7 the stream and /dev/hakios-camera (0 or none: nothing)
 *   cam_s9_always=1    with 7: the stream from the boot to the run's end, wanted or not (the old behaviour, for debugging)
 *   cam_s9_addr=A      the sensor's 7-bit I2C address, if not 0x35 (the device tree's) and not found by the scan
 *   cam_s9_ipclk=MHZ   the two HSI2Cs' input clock in MHz (default 400, as the phone showed for the other buses on 1
 *                      November: a wrong guess on the high side only makes the bus slower)
 *   cam_s9_exp=LINES   the first exposure of step 5's frame in lines of 26.3 us (default 1000, at most 1262)
 *   cam_s9_gain=CODE   the first analog gain of step 5's frame, 0x20 being 1x (default 0x40, at most 0x200)
 *   cam_s9_ae=0        no auto-exposure: the frames as cam_s9_exp and cam_s9_gain have them (default 1: on)
 *   cam_s9_ae_frames=N the auto-exposure's frames at most before a camshot's frame is taken (2 to 30, default 15)
 *   cam_s9_dgain=CODE  the most digital gain the auto-exposure may use, 0x100 being 1x (default 0x400, at most 0x1000)
 *   cam_s9_sat=PCT     camshot's colour saturation in per cent (default 140; 100: none; at most 300)
 *   cam_s9_pack12=1    the WDMA's PACK12 layout rather than RAW10 as it comes (the BSP sets PACK12 for its V4L2
 *                      SBGGR10 buffers). Without it the WDMA writes each RAW10 pixel in 16 bits, little-endian, the
 *                      value in [9:0] (the phone, 3 November): camshot's debayer reads only that)
 *   cam_s9_bayer=N     camshot's Bayer order: 0 RGGB, 1 GRBG (the default, the sensor's), 2 GBRG, 3 BGGR
 *   cam_s9_stride=B    camshot's bytes a line of the frame (default 3264: the WDMA's RAW10 is a pixel in 16 bits)
 *   cam_s9_ispdiv=D    CLKCMU_ISPPRE_BUS (CSIS1's and its WDMA's clock) = SHARED1_DIV4, 466 MHz, / (D + 1); default
 *                      1, 233 MHz (Android's own is 466 MHz, D = 0). The boot leaves it at about 50 MHz, too slow:
 *                      CSIS1 overflows and the WDMA's FIFO fills a few lines into the frame
 *   cam_s9_probe=1     the risky reads too, for the log: CMU_ISPPRE's whole Q-channel sweep with each DBG_NFO (+0x4000),
 *                      and the other three CSISs' DMA commons (read, and their interrupt masks for the pattern's while).
 *                      Off by default: on 3 November the sweep's read of CMU_ISPPRE 0x303C took a synchronous external
 *                      abort (isp_status(), the phone's cam-fix.img)
 *   cam_s9_mmu_probe=1 the SysMMU (0x16310000) mapped and read: MMU_CTRL/CFG/STATUS/VERSION in the log, and a SysMMU
 *                      found translating stops the DMA. Off by default (its clock or Q-channel may be off, and a read
 *                      then aborts, as the PCIe SysMMU's did): the SysMMU is taken as off, pass-through, and the DMA
 *                      starts without asking it
 *   cam_s9_rear_probe=N Star2's primary rear camera (S5K2L3 at 0x10 on hsi2c@10860000): N=2 powers it up at the start
 *                      exactly as its stream does (rear_up()), reads its model ID and revision, and powers it down again.
 *                      Only in a star2lte kernel. Telephoto, OIS, AF and aperture are never powered
 *   cam_s9_rear=1      with 7: the rear camera's stream too (Star2 only): a reader's HAKIOS_CAMERA_SENSOR 1 ends the
 *                      front camera's stream and starts the rear's, 2016 x 1512 RAW10 at 30 from CSIS0 (four lanes at
 *                      1352 Mb/s), and back. A rear stream that fails is not tried again in the run: the front's
 *                      frames go on, so the front camera stays usable
 *   cam_s9_rear_exp=L  the rear stream's first exposure in lines of 815 ns (default 30000, about 24 ms; its gain starts at 4x)
 *   cam_s9_rear_ispdiv=D  the ISPPRE bus clock for the rear stream, 466 MHz / (D + 1); default 0, Android's rate.
 *                      (Four lanes at 1352 Mb/s are more than the front camera's 233 MHz can take.)
 *   cam_s9_rear_bayer=N  the rear frames' Bayer order (default 1, GRBG: fimc-is-cis-2l3.c's GR_BG with 0x0101 = 3)
 *   cam_s9_rear_turn=1  the rear frames turned half round for user space (default 0: the sensor flips itself)
 *   cam_s9_rear_tp=N  the rear sensor's MIPI CCS test pattern (0x0600: 1 solid colour, 2 colour bars) for its picture
 *   cam_s9_tele_probe=1  Star2's telephoto camera (S5K3M3, "rear2", at 0x2D on hsi2c@10880000): powered up at the start
 *                      exactly as its stream does (tele_up()), its model ID and revision read, powered down again. A tele
 *                      that does not answer is not used for the run (kern.hakios.camera_tele = 0). Star2 only
 *   cam_s9_tele=1      with 7: the telephoto's stream (Star2 only): a reader's HAKIOS_CAMERA_SENSOR 4 starts it, 2016 x
 *                      1512 RAW10 at 30 (Apollo's mode 4, 2x2 binned) from CSIS2 (four lanes at 1196 Mb/s on the M4S4
 *                      "mod" D-PHY, 0x16170000). A tele stream that fails is not tried again in the run; the sysctl
 *                      kern.hakios.camera_tele says 0 then, and user space shows the wide camera's frames in its place
 *   cam_s9_tele_exp=L  the tele stream's first exposure in lines of 20.3 us (default 1000; its gain starts at 4x)
 *   cam_s9_tele_tp=N  the tele sensor's MIPI CCS test pattern (0x0600: 1 solid colour, 2 colour bars) for its picture
 *   cam_s9_tele_bayer=N  the tele frames' Bayer order (default 1, GRBG: fimc-is-cis-3m3.c's GR_BG)
 *   cam_s9_tele_turn=1  the tele frames turned half round for user space (default 0, as Apollo streams it: no flip)
 *                      (0x0101 = 0, no mirror and no flip; whether its module sits the other way up from the wide
 *                      one's is not in the sources: the phone's picture will say)
 *

 * 1196 aligned to 1200), cmucal-sfr.c (I2C_CAM2/3 gates, Q-channels, dividers):
 *   supplies   all on the S2MPB02, none shared with the wide camera: VDD_EXT_1P3_PB02 (BUCK2, 1.3 V; the front camera's
 *              too), VDDA_2.8V_SUB (LDO11), VDDD_1.05V_SUB (LDO3, 1.05 V), VDDAF_2.8V_SUB (LDO12, and 2 ms),
 *              VDDIO_1.8V_SUB (LDO7, and 100 us). Apollo (CONFIG_OIS_USE) also powers the OIS here (VDDD_1.8V_OIS,
 *              VDD_VM_2.8V_OIS on the S2MPB03, VDDD_2.8V_OIS, its reset gpg0-6), shared with the wide camera's module:
 *              NOT done here. The OIS sits on I2C_CAM1, the wide's lens bus; the tele's sensor (I2C_CAM2) and lens motor
 *              (I2C_CAM3) have buses of their own, so neither waits on it
 *   the rest   the bus pins gpc0-4/5 to I2C (function 2, pull-ups), 10 us; MCLK0 (CIS_CLK0, gpc1-4: the WIDE camera's
 *              MCLK too -- one rear sensor is powered at a time) at 26 MHz; the reset gpg2-7 high, 8 ms. Off: the reset

 *              (USE_GROUP_PARAM_HOLD 0). Line 0x2628 clocks of 481 MHz (20308 ns), frame 0x667 lines, margin 0x1C.
 *              Its sensor-shift crop (CAMERA_REAR2_SENSOR_SHIFT_CROP, from the module's calibration) is not applied
 *   the focus  its own AK737x at 0x0F on I2C_CAM3 (gpc0-6/7), supplied by VDDAF_2.8V_SUB: af_up() as the others'
 *
 * Limits, whatever asks. The S2MPB02 makes other supplies too (the flash LED, the rear camera's lens motor, the grip
 * sensor, the proximity LED): every write to it goes through one function that takes only the four LDO registers and
 * BUCK2's two above, only the values above (Android's voltages, on or off; BUCK2's control register only in its enable
 * bits), and reads each back; a write that does not read back, or a byte
 * nobody acknowledges, and everything is powered down in the power-down's order and nothing more is done for the run.
 * A supply found on is left as it is and left on at the end; one found on at another voltage stops the run before
 * anything is written (someone else has it). No other PMIC register is written. The flashlight's driver stays off in a
 * run with cam_s9=N (the same bus, one driver per bus). Nothing of the ISPPRE block is read before its domain is seen
 * on. The DMA is given only the buffer's address, checked to lie below 4 GB, and with the SysMMU taken as off (seen off, with cam_s9_mmu_probe=1). Every
 * wait is bounded by the clock.
 *

 * a colour matrix and lens shading of the module's own.
