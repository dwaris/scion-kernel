 * The lens of the Galaxy S9's front camera (starlte, Exynos 9810): its motor's driver chip, an AKM AK737x, the module's
 * calibration EEPROM beside it, and an autofocus by contrast over the frames hakios.exynos_camera.c takes. Only with
 * boot-arg cam_af=N in a run with cam_s9=N on this phone: the camera's driver calls in here, and with cam_af absent
 * or 0 nothing below runs (no register of the bus, the chip or the pins is read or written) and the camera is as it
 * was. Every address and number is this phone's, from its device tree and the S9 kernel's actuator driver, read as
 * data.
 *
 * THE HARDWARE
 *   the motor      an AK737x (the device tree expects product 0x0C, an AK7372) at 0x0C (7 bits) on hsi2c@10900000.
 *                  8-bit register addresses:
 *                    0x00  the position's bits [8:1]
 *                    0x01  the position's bit 0, in bit 7
 *                    0x02  the mode: 0x00 active (the coil driven to the position), 0x20 sleep
 *                    0x03  reads the product: 0x09 AK7371, 0x0C AK7372, 0x0E AK7374
 *                  The position is 9 bits, 0 (the furthest: infinity) to 511 (the nearest: macro). Android's order
 *                  after the supplies: the product read, the first position written (120 for this module), 10 ms, the
 *                  mode to active; the mode to sleep before the supplies go.
 *   NEVER WRITTEN  The chip has a memory of its own for its settings, and Android's driver has a one-time path that
 *                  rewrites it (an unlock at 0xAE, the settings at 0x10-0x25, store commands written to 0x03). None
 *                  of that is here: lens_put() takes only 0x00, 0x01 and 0x02, and only the values above, and
 *                  refuses everything else whoever asks. 0x03 and 0x10 are read, for the log.
 *   its supply     VDDAF_2.8V_VT, the S2MPB02's LDO16 at 2.8 V: hakios.exynos_camera.c switches it with the sensor's
 *                  other supplies (Android's order), so the chip has power whenever the sensor has, and none when the
 *                  camera is down. Nothing here writes to the S2MPB02.
 *   the bus        hsi2c@10900000: the USI block of USI09 in PERIC1 ("hsi2c22"), 400 kHz; its mode word usi@10811034
 *                  ("i2c": 4); pins gpp5-4 (SCL) and gpp5-5 (SDA) of PERIC1's GPIO (0x10830020), function 2 while
 *                  the camera is up, function 0 (inputs) when it is down, no pull. In CMU_PERIC1 (0x10800000):
 *                  GATE_CLK_PERIC1_USI09_USI 0x2044, its reset synchroniser's clock 0x20A4, the block's IPCLK 0x2104
 *                  and PCLK 0x2108, QCH_CON_USI09_USI_QCH 0x3048, DIV_CLK_PERIC1_USI09_USI 0x1824. The sensor's own
 *                  bus is the neighbour on pins 2 and 3 of the same bank (hakios.exynos_camera.c)
 *   the EEPROM     the module's calibration memory at 0x51 on the same bus, 16-bit addresses, 16 KB. Read only, and
 *                  only ever as a random read with a repeated start (the two address bytes, no STOP, then the read):
 *                  nothing is stored by a memory of this kind without a STOP after a data byte. Read once a run: the
 *                  header (0x00-0x5F: the sections' addresses, the header's version at 0x30, the map's version at
 *                  0x40, the project's name at 0x4C) and the start of the focus section (0x100-0x11F: the lens's
 *                  position for infinity at 0x104 and for macro at 0x110, as the factory measured them). The module's
 *                  serial number (0xA8 on) is not read.
 *
 * THE STAGES (cam_af=N)
 *   1  a look: the bus, the product read, the registers 0x00-0x02 and 0x10 as found, the EEPROM's header and focus
 *      section. Nothing is written to the chip: the lens does not move.
 *   2  that, and the lens held where it is told: at cam_af_pos (120, Android's first position, unless said) from each
 *      power-up of the camera. With the stream (cam_s9=7): the middle's sharpness in the log, and sysctl
 *      kern.hakios.lens.go (the USB console's "sysctl kern.hakios.lens.go=N"): 0-511 the lens there, 1000 the table,
 *      the sharpness at every cam_af_coarse-th position of the travel, the lens put back after. cam_af_walk=1 makes
 *      the table once by itself when the first stream's exposure has settled.
 *   3  that, and the autofocus: when a stream's exposure has settled the travel is measured in steps of cam_af_coarse
 *      (32), then the stretch around the sharpest in steps of cam_af_fine (8), and the lens put at the sharpest. It
 *      stays there until the middle has been less than cam_af_drop per cent (60) as sharp as it was found for most of
 *      a second; then the search is made again. kern.hakios.lens.go=1001 asks for a search now.
 *   4  that, and iOS: the frames of /dev/hakios-camera carry the lens's position (0 to 1022, twice the chip's), and
 *      HAKIOS_CAMERA_FOCUS is taken: a = 0 to 1023 puts the lens there (half of it, the chip's 9 bits) and stops the
 *      kernel's own search until the stream ends (the capture device in user space searches by itself, a step at
 *      a time, and a search of its own would fight it); a = 0xffffffff (HAKIOS_CAMERA_NO_FOCUS) asks the kernel's
 *      search instead, at once, on a window: with b not 0 its middle is c across and d down, in 1024ths of the picture
 *      as read() gives it (a tap), with b 0 the picture's middle.
 *
 * THE MEASURE. A window of cam_af_win pixels square (384; the middle of the frame, or where a tap asked), read as
 * the WDMA wrote it (RAW10 in 16 bits): the sum of the squares of each pixel's difference from the next of its own
 * colour to the right and below (two pixels away: the Bayer pattern itself is no contrast), over the pixel count and
 * the square of the mean above black, so that a change of exposure changes it little. While a search or a table is
 * being made the exposure is held (the camera's driver is told), and each position is measured on the frame
 * cam_af_settle frames (2) after the one in which the lens was sent there: the frame exposing during the move is
 * smeared, and the chip settles in less than a frame. The lens is walked, at most 48 steps of its 511 in a write and
 * 3 ms between writes, never thrown; before the supplies go it is walked down to the furthest end of the search's
 * travel and the chip put to sleep.
 *
 * SEEN ON THE PHONE (12 November 2026, iOS 16.5 kernel, one scene: a wall with a framed picture about two metres off)
 *   stage 1  the chip answers: product 0x0C; as found after power-up its position registers 0 and its mode 0x40. The
 *            EEPROM answers: header "W08LLKF00PM", map "V003", project "000STARL"; the factory's positions 233
 *            (infinity) and 304 (macro), which are in the chip's own 9-bit steps: the wall was sharpest just past 233
 *   stage 2  the table, twice: the sharpness 300 at 0, 1000 at 240, 330 at 496, one clean peak; camshots at 0, 120, 240
 *            and 400 show it
 *   stage 3  two searches (the second asked by kern.hakios.lens.go=1001): both ended at 248, 71 frames (2.4 s) after
 *            they began, the stream at 30 frames a second throughout. The search-again path (the sharpness dropping)
 *            and stage 4 have not been seen: the phone lay still, and nothing in user space asked.
 *
 * Boot-args (all read only with cam_af not 0):
 *   cam_af=N          1 a look, 2 the lens held at cam_af_pos, 3 the autofocus, 4 that and HAKIOS_CAMERA_FOCUS (0 or
 *                     none: nothing)
 *   cam_af_pos=P      stage 2's position, and where the lens is put first at 3 and 4 (0-511; 120 unless said)
 *   cam_af_lo=P cam_af_hi=P   the travel searched (0 and 511 unless said)
 *   cam_af_coarse=S cam_af_fine=S   the search's two steps (32 and 8)
 *   cam_af_settle=F   frames let go by after a move before the measurement (1-6, 2 unless said)
 *   cam_af_win=W      the window's side in pixels (64-512, 384 unless said)
 *   cam_af_drop=PCT   the sharpness, in per cent of what the search found, below which it is made again (60)
 *   cam_af_walk=1     stage 2: the table once, by itself
 *   cam_af_x=X cam_af_y=Y   the window's middle when nobody has tapped, in 1024ths of the frame as the sensor gives
 *                     it (camshot's picture): 512 and 512, the middle, unless said
 *
 * Sources: the phone's device tree (exynos9810-starlte_eur_open_26.dts: hsi2c@10900000 and its fimc-is-actuator@0C and
 * front_eeprom@51, hsi2c22-bus, usi@10811034) and, of the S9 kernel, fimc-is-actuator-ak737x.c/.h (the registers, the
